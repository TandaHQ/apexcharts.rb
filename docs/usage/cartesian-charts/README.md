### Cartesian Charts

Example series used for cartesian charts:

```erb
<% series = [
  {name: "Inactive", data: @inactive_properties},
  {name: "Active", data: @active_properties}
] %>
```
To build the data, you can use gem [groupdate](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate).  
In my case, it was:

```ruby
@inactive_properties = Property.inactive.group_by_week(:created_at).count
@active_properties = Property.active.group_by_week(:created_at).count
```

and I'll get the data in this format:
```ruby
{
  Sun, 29 Jul 2018=>1,
  Sun, 05 Aug 2018=>6,
  ..
}
```
PS: `Property` can be any model you have and `inactive` and `active`
are just some normal ActiveRecord scopes. Keep scrolling down to see
accepted data formats.  

Example options used for cartesian charts:

```erb
<% options = {
  title: 'Properties Growth',
  subtitle: 'Grouped Per Week',
  xtitle: 'Week',
  ytitle: 'Properties',
  stacked: true
} %>
```
